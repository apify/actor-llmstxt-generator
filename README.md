The **/llms.txt Generator** is an Apify Actor that helps you extract essential website content and generate an [/llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) file, making your content ready for AI-powered applications such as fine-tuning, indexing, and integrating large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, ChatGPT, or LLaMA. This Actor leverages the [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler) actor to perform deep crawls and extract text content from web pages, ensuring comprehensive data collection. The Website Content Crawler is particularly useful because it supports output in multiple formats, including markdown, which is used by the **/llms.txt**.

## üåü What is /llms.txt?

The **/llms.txt** format is a markdown-based standard for providing AI-friendly content. It contains:

- **Brief background information** and guidance.
- **Links to additional resources** in markdown format.
- **AI-focused** structure to help coders, researchers, and AI models easily access and use website content.

Proposed structure:

```
# Title

> Optional description

Optional details go here

## Section name

- [Link title](https://link_url): Optional link details

## Optional

- [Link title](https://link_url)
```

By adding an **/llms.txt** file to your website, you make it easy for AI systems to understand, index, and use your content effectively.

## üéØ Features of /llms.txt Generator

Our Actor is designed to simplify and automate the creation of **/llms.txt** files. Here are its key features:

- **Deep website crawling**: Extracts content from multi-level websites using the powerful [Crawlee](https://crawlee.dev) library and the [Website Content Crawler](https://apify.com/apify/website-content-crawler) Actor.
- **Content extraction**: Retrieves key metadata such as titles, descriptions, and URLs for seamless integration.
- **File generation**: Saves the output in the standardized **/llms.txt** format.
- **Downloadable output**: The **/llms.txt** file can be downloaded from the **key-value store** in the storage section of the Actor run details.
- **Resource management**: Limits the crawler Actor to 4 GB of memory to ensure compatibility with the free tier, which has an 8 GB limit. Note that this may slow down the crawling process.
